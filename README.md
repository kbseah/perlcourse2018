# Notes for Perl Course 2018 at MPI Bremen

Instructor: Brandon Seah

Material is partly based on Perl course 2017 which was developed by Lizbeth Sayavedra, Juliane Wippler, and Brandon Seah.

 * Example scripts and exercises for each day are in separate folders
 * Open each example file in a text editor and have a look inside before running it
 * Run Perl scripts with the command `perl script_name.pl`
 * Some files have exercises for you to try
