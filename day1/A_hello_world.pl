#!/usr/bin/env perl
# The line above is called a "shebang" line, and tells the Unix-like
# operating system that this is a perl script

# Lines starting with the # character are not interpreted and can be used to
# leave explanations or comments in plain language

# The print function prints output to the screen
print "Hello world\n";

# Lines of code in perl end with semicolons ;
# A single line of complex code can be very long - this lets you split it up
# over several actual lines to improve readability, as long as there is a
# semicolon at the end

## EXERCISE ####################################################################

# Uncomment the following lines to see what happens when you run the code

# What does \n do?
#print "Hello world\n";
#print "Hello world";

# Single vs double quotes - any difference?
#print "Hello world\n";
#print 'Hello world\n';
